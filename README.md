🎲 Flutter Dice App
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of my Flutter Basics Learning Roadmap.
I built a Dice App that simulates rolling dice using Flutter widgets, images, and state management.
The app demonstrates how to create interactive UI elements where the dice values change when a button is pressed or when the dice itself is clicked.

🛠️ Features

🎨 Custom UI with Scaffold & AppBar

🧊 Images as dice faces (dynamically rendered)

🎲 Random number generation (dart:math) for dice rolls

🔄 StatefulWidget & setState to update UI in real-time

📱 Two interaction methods:

Button press to roll the first dice

Clicking directly on the second dice image

🎯 What I Learned

This app focuses on core Flutter concepts, including:

✅ Difference between StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget

✅ Managing UI updates with setState

✅ Using Row and Column for responsive layouts

✅ Adding and displaying local image assets

✅ Styling TextButtons

✅ Handling user interactions (button clicks & image taps)

✅ Implementing randomness with Random() from dart:math
